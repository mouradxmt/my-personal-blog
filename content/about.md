# About me

I am Mourad MTOUAA, a Software Engineer who is passionate about everything related to Computer Science and electronics :D

I am in love with Open Source culture, Java ecosystem and code in general.

I work daily with containers and DevOps stuff.

Beside coding and software engineering, I am interested in entrepreneurship, literature and history.
